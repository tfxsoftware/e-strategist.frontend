UI Style Guide: E-Strategist (The "War Council" Aesthetic)

This document defines the visual language for the "E-Strategist" management interface, inspired by classic 2000s-era fantasy RTS games (Warcraft 3 style).

1. Color Palette (Ancient & Arcane)

Background: #0d0d0d (Deep Abyss) or #111111 (Dark Slate).

Stone Primary: #2d2d2d (Granite) with #3d3d3d (Light Highlight) and #1a1a1a (Shadow).

Etched Gold: #c4a45a (Primary Accents/Titles) and #ffcc00 (Glow/High-value data).

Arcane Green: #0e4a0e (Health/Energy) and #33ff33 (Runic Glow).

Blood Red: #4a0e0e (Bans/Danger/Forfeit) and #ff0000 (Glow).

Parchment/Text: #e0c8a0 (Body Text) and #7a6a4a (Dimmed/Secondary).

2. Typography

Headings: High-contrast Serif fonts (e.g., Cinzel, Trajan, or EB Garamond) with font-black and italic for an etched look.

Data/Body: Clean Serif or Monospace fonts (Courier Prime or JetBrains Mono) for technical readouts within the fantasy frames.

3. The "War Council" HUD

The interface is framed by heavy "Stone" components that simulate a physical command console.

Left Sidebar: The "Citadel Menu" – Stone tablets for navigation.

Bottom HUD: The "Status Bar" – Features the Manager's Crest, gold-etched balance, and the team's vital experience/energy bars.

Center Viewport: The "Scrying Stone" – The main interaction area where roster management and matches occur.

4. Visual Effects & Textures

Beveled Stone: Using CSS border-shading to create 3D depth.

Top/Left Borders: Lighter grey.

Bottom/Right Borders: Darker grey/Black.

Texture Overlays: Subtle SVG or transparent PNG overlays representing Leather, Dark Wood, or Chiseled Stone to give elements "grit."

The Runic Glow: box-shadow and text-shadow using the Green/Red/Gold palette to indicate active states or magical significance.

5. UI Elements

Runic Buttons: Rectangular blocks with a "rocker-switch" feel. Dark red/gold gradients with an inner texture.

Progress Bars: Segmented bars inspired by classic health bars.

Energy: Green/Emerald gradient.

Experience: Gold/Yellow gradient.

Marketplace: Listed as "Mercenary Contracts." Buying a player feels like signing a blood-oath or an ancient scroll.

6. Layout Strategy

The "Citadel" Layout: A persistent 3-column frame.

Sidebars: Static stone pillars.

Content: A "window" look where the content appears to be recessed into the stone frame.

Overlay: A global "Vignette" and "Dark Matter" texture to create a sense of looking into a dark, candle-lit room.
